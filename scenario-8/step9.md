If you do this the first time, it all looks a bit overwhelming. But then it's only been an hour of work or so, which seems reasonable - even more so if you stretch it out over multiple iterations. One thing to help you get up to speed is getting an overview of all the alerts standing behind the scores. Itâ€™s a good idea to have a look at the distribution of the scores as described above. A good next step is to get a report of how exactly the *anomaly scores* occurred, such as an overview of the rule violations for each anomaly score. The following construct generates a report like this. On the first line, we extract a list of anomaly scores from the incoming requests which actually appear in the log file. We then build a loop around these *scores*, read the *request ID* for each *score*, save it in the file `ids` and perform a short analysis for these *IDs* in the *error log*.

```
cat tutorial-8-example-access.log | alscorein | sort -n | uniq | egrep -v -E "^0" > scores
```{{execute}}

```
cat scores | while read S; do echo "INCOMING SCORE $S";\
grep -E " $S [0-9-]+$" tutorial-8-example-access.log \
| alreqid > ids; grep -F -f ids tutorial-8-example-error.log | melidmsg | sucs; echo ; done 
```{{execute}}

```

Before we finish with this tutorial, let me iterate my tuning policy again:

* Always work in blocking mode
* Highest scoring requests go first
* Work in several iterations

When you grow more proficient, you can reduce the number of iterations and tackle more false alarms in a single batch. Or you can concentrate on the rules that are triggered most often. That may work as well and in the end, when all rule exclusions are in place, you should end up with the same configuration. But in my experience, the policy with the three simple guiding rules is the one with the highest chance of success and the one with the lowest drop out rate.

We have now reached the end of the block consisting of three *ModSecurity tutorials*. The next one will look into setting up a *reverse proxy*.

A similar script that has been slightly extended is part of my private toolbox.

This is how you end up with a tight ModSecurity CRS setup in blocking mode with a low anomaly scoring limit.
