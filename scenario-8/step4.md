We have tuned away the alerts leading to the highest anomaly scores. Actually, anything above 100 is now gone. In a production setup, I would deploy the updated configuration and observe the behaviour a bit. If the high scores are really gone, then it is time to reduce the anomaly limit. A typical first step is from 10,000 to 100. Then we do more rules exclusions, reduce to 50 or so, then to 20, 10 and 5. In fact, a limit of 5 is really strong (first critical alert blocks a request), but for sites with less security needs, a limit of 10 might just be good enough. Anything above does not really block attackers.

But before we get there, we need to add few more rule exclusions.
