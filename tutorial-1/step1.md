## Step 1 - Preparing the directory tree for the source code

Itâ€™s not all that important where the source code is located. The following is a recommendation based on the [File Hierarchy Standard](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/). The FHS defines the path structure of a Unix system; the structure for all stored files. Note that in the second command whoami evaluates to the username and not root (despite sudo).

```
sudo mkdir /usr/src/apache
sudo chown `whoami` /usr/src/apache
cd /usr/src/apache
```{execute}
