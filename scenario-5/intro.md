This is a Katacoda scenario based on a tutorial that has been published as part of a larger series of Apache / ModSecurity / OWASP Core Rule Set tutorials at [netnea](https://netnea.com/apache-tutorials).

### What are we doing?

We are defining a greatly extended log format in order to better monitor traffic.


### Why are we doing this?

In the usual configuration of the Apache web server a log format is used that logs only the most necessary information about access from different clients. In practice, additional information is often required, which can easily be recorded in the server's access log.


### Requirements

**The requirements are already met here on Katacoda. So nothing to do for you and you can start immediately.**

* An Apache web server, ideally one created using the file structure shown in [Tutorial 1 (Compiling Apache)](https://www.netnea.com/cms/apache-tutorial-1_compiling-apache/).
* Understanding of the minimal configuration in [Tutorial 2 (Configuring a Minimal Apache Web Server)](https://www.netnea.com/cms/apache-tutorial-2_minimal-apache-configuration/).
* An Apache web server with SSL/TLS support as in [Tutorial 4 (Enabling Encryption with SSL/TLS)](https://www.netnea.com/cms/apache-tutorial-4_configuring-ssl-tls/).
