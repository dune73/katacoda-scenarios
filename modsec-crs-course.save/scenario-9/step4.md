Continuing on in the configuration: now comes the Proxy block where the connection to the backend is more precisely defined. Specifically, this is where requests are authenticated and authorized. Further below in the tutorial we will also be adding a load balancer to this block.

The proxy block is similar to the location and the directory block we have previously become familiar with in our configuration. These are called containers. Containers specify to the web server how to structure the work. When a container appears in the configuration, it prepares a processing structure for it. In the case of `mod_proxy` the backend can also be accessed without a Proxy container. However, access protection is not taken into account and other directives no longer have any place where it can be inserted. Without the Proxy block the processing of complex servers remains a bit haphazard and it would do us well to configure this part as well. Using the ProxySet directive, we could intervene even more here and specify things like the connection behavior. Min, max and smax can be used to specify the number of threads assigned to the proxy connection pool. This can impact performance from case to case. The keep-alive behavior of the proxy connection can be influenced and a variety of different timeouts defined for it. Additional information is available in the Apache Project documentation.
